# SkillPilot

**The right skill, at the right time — without filling your context window.**

SkillPilot is an open-source MCP server that routes agent skills from your filesystem. It picks the best skill for each task, injects only what you need, and cleans up when the work is done. Built for Cursor, Claude Desktop, and any MCP-compatible host.

---

## Install

**npm:** [`skillpilot-mcp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/skillpilot-mcp)

Add this to **Cursor Settings → MCP** or your project’s `.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "skillpilot": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "skillpilot-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "SKILL_ROOT": "${workspaceFolder}/.agents/skills"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

One-line MCP command (what `npx` runs):

```bash
npx -y skillpilot-mcp@latest
```

Install the package into a project (optional — MCP config above uses `npx` and needs no local install):

```bash
npm install skillpilot-mcp
```

Point `SKILL_ROOT` at your project’s `.agents/skills` folder. Omit it to use the **bundled** catalog shipped inside the package. Create `.agents/skills` and add skills with `npx skills add`, or use the bundled catalog as-is.

**Requirements:** Node.js 18+

## Why SkillPilot?

Agents work better with skills — structured playbooks for code review, MCP development, UI design, and more. But dumping entire skill libraries into every turn is expensive: wrong skills add noise, large bodies burn tokens, and stale guidance lingers after a task ends.

SkillPilot treats context as a budget:

- **Select on summaries, not full files** — routing reads ~60 tokens per skill, not thousands.
- **Inject with depth control** — summary, compact, section, or full body depending on what you need.
- **Plan before you execute** — map which skills a multi-step goal needs before loading anything heavy.
- **End tasks cleanly** — `end_task` evicts injected guidance so the next conversation stays focused.

Research on skill-augmented agents (e.g. [Skill0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.02268)) shows filtered, summary-first routing can cut per-step token cost sharply versus naïve full injection — often with better task alignment. SkillPilot brings that discipline to inference-time MCP workflows.

## How it works

```text
Your prompt
    │
    ▼
skill_plan (optional)     ← Tier 1 only: which skills, in what order
    │
    ▼
begin_task                  ← match + shaped inject + session file
    │
    ▼
Agent works with skill body
    │
    ▼
end_task                    ← cleanup + clear session
```

Skills live as folders under **`.agents/skills/<skill-id>/SKILL.md`**. SkillPilot-specific metadata (tags, triggers, inject defaults) can live in **`.agents/skills-meta/<skill-id>.yaml`** so ecosystem skills survive `npx skills update` without hand-editing upstream files.

---

## Features

| Capability | What you get |
|------------|----------------|
| **Heuristic routing** | Tag and trigger matching on Tier 1 metadata; no LLM required for selection |
| **Token budgets** | Exclude skills whose bodies exceed your remaining context headroom |
| **Inject modes** | `summary` · `compact` · `sections` · `full` — escalate only when stuck |
| **Task lifecycle** | `begin_task` / `end_task` with `.skillpilot/session.json` as source of truth |
| **Metadata overlays** | Patch routing for community skills without touching their `SKILL.md` bodies |
| **Open stack** | Node.js, stdio MCP, MIT-friendly deps — no API keys at install time |

## Quick start

### Develop from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Troy-LL/SkillPilot.git
cd SkillPilot
npm install
npm run build
```

Local MCP entry (repo-relative):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "skillpilot": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["<REPO>/SkillPilot/scripts/run-mcp.mjs"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

`run-mcp.mjs` sets `SKILL_ROOT` and `SKILLPILOT_SKILLS_META_DIR` from the repo. See [`docs/mcp-config.example.json`](docs/mcp-config.example.json).

### npm publish

Maintainers: `npm login` then `npm publish --access public` from this directory. See [`docs/PUBLISHING.md`](docs/PUBLISHING.md).

### Cursor Marketplace plugin

This repo includes [`.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`](.cursor-plugin/plugin.json) for the [Cursor Marketplace](https://cursor.com/marketplace). Local test and submission: [`docs/PUBLISHING.md`](docs/PUBLISHING.md).

**Verify locally:**

```bash
# Bash
export SKILL_ROOT="$(pwd)/.agents/skills"
npm run smoke

# PowerShell
$env:SKILL_ROOT = "$PWD/.agents/skills"
npm run smoke
```

## Growing your skill catalog

1. **Discover** — use the bundled **find-skills** skill or `npx skills find <query>` on [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/).
2. **Install project-local** — from the repo root: `npx skills add <package> -y` (no `-g`). Skills land in `.agents/skills/`.
3. **Add routing metadata** — create `.agents/skills-meta/<id>.yaml` with `tags`, `triggers`, and optional `inject_mode_default: compact` for large skills.
4. **Route** — MCP reads `.agents/skills` and merges overlays automatically.

## MCP tools

Lifecycle tools (recommended for agents):

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `skill_plan` | Plan which skills a goal needs — summaries only, no bodies loaded |
| `begin_task` | Select, inject, and open a task session |
| `end_task` | Cleanup and clear the session |
| `get_session` | Read the active episode (optional body) |

Low-level tools (debugging and custom flows):

| Tool | Aliases |
|------|---------|
| `list` | `skill_list` |
| `select` | `skill_select` |
| `load` | `skill_inject` |
| `cleanup` | `skill_cleanup` |
| `health` | — |
| `ingest` | Optional copy into legacy `skills/` tree |

`load` and `begin_task` support **`inject_mode`** (`summary` | `compact` | `sections` | `full`) and **`token_budget`** to auto-pick depth. See [`docs/CONTEXT_ENGINEERING.md`](docs/CONTEXT_ENGINEERING.md).

---

## Configuration

Copy [`skillpilot.config.json.example`](skillpilot.config.json.example) to `skillpilot.config.json` to tune defaults:

```json
{
  "skillsRoot": "./.agents/skills",
  "defaultInjectMode": "compact",
  "maxInjectBytes": 8192,
  "defaultTokenBudget": 2048
}
```

Resolution order for the skill root: `--skill-root` → `SKILL_ROOT` env → config file → `./.agents/skills`.

MCP protocol traffic uses **stdout** only; logs go to **stderr** as structured JSON.

---

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run build` | Compile TypeScript to `dist/` |
| `npm start` | Run the MCP server (stdio) |
| `npm test` | Unit tests |
| `npm run smoke` | End-to-end MCP lifecycle check |
| `npm run benchmark` | Token savings + selection regression |
| `npm run skills:add -- <pkg>` | Install a skill into `.agents/skills` |

The legacy `skills/` directory is optional — used only if you dogfood the `ingest` tool.
